javacountdown
=============

Site that mimics the spirit of ie6countdown.net to encourage users to move to the latest and greatest Java!

A simple message of:

"15 years ago an amazing language was born. Its name was Java. Now
that we’re in 2013, the world has changed and Java along with it! For
Java versions 4, 5 and 6, it’s time to say goodbye.

This website is dedicated to watching Java 4, 5 & 6 usage drop to less
than 1% worldwide, so hundreds of millions of users are safer and 9-10
million developers are more productive"

"Move to Java 7 today!"

A sub message for really conservative enterprises could be added.

"If you really can't move today, then at least get a support contract/
Java for business license from Oracle so that your older Java and
therefore your customers and your business are kept safer."
